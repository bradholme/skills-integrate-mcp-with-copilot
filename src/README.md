## Role-Based Access Control

The system implements three user roles with specific permissions:

- **Students**: Can sign up for activities
- **Teachers**: Can unregister students from activities (requires teacher authentication)
- **Staff**: No specific activity permissions currently defined

### Web Interface Role Controls

- **Activity Signup**: Students can use the signup form to join activities
- **Student Unregistration**: Clicking the ‚ùå button next to a participant prompts for teacher email authentication

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Users** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Role (student, teacher, staff)

2. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:
   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
